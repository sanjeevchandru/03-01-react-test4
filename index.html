       1. What is the output of below code?
        import { useState } from 'react';  export default function Counter() { 
              const [counter, setCounter] = useState(5);    return ( <>     
                < span>{counter}< /span>       < button onClick={ ( ) => {      
                       setCounter(counter + 5);         setCounter(counter + 5);    
                            alert(counter);         setCounter(counter + 5);       
                              setCounter(counter + 5);       }}>Increment< /button>     </>   ) } 
                              
        output:5   alert:5  when to click alert btn=>ok,then count value is increse ,the dom is update
        ex:   10   alert :10 
                    <hr>
        2.What will be the output of the below code if the button is clicked:

        function App() { 
         const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
         useEffect(() => {
         console.log("Component rendered successfully");   }, []); 
         return (
         < div> 
           	< button onClick={ ( ) => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me< /button>
           	< p>You clicked {count} times< /p>
     	< /div>   ); }      
        
        output:You clicked 14 times    console=>Component rendered successfully (onetime)
        <hr>
        3.How do you create forms in React?    
        React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page.
         In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
          When the data is handled by the components, all the data is
           stored in the component state. You can control changes by adding
            event handlers in the onChange attribute and that event handler
             will be used to update the state of the variable.
        Ex:< form>
            < label>Input Value:< /label>
            < input  type="text"  value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
            < /form>
            < p>Input Value: {inputValue}< /p> 
            <hr>
        4. Explain lifecycle methods.       
        These methods allow you to control the component's behavior
         and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.
         A component's lifecycle has three main phases: the Mounting Phase,
          the Updating Phase, and the Unmounting Phase.

        5.Can web browsers read JSX directly?  
        JSX isn't directly supported by browsers, requiring conversion
         by tools like Babel to transform JSX into valid JavaScript.
          This transpilation ensures browsers can interpret and execute
           the JSX-embedded code in React applications.

        6.How Do You Handle Forms in React?
        In React, form data is usually handled by the components. 
        When the data is handled by the components, all the data is
         stored in the component state. You can control changes by
          adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.

        7.What is virtual dom in the react?    
        Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly,
         React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does 
         all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes 
         in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed!

        8.In React, Why Is There a Need for Using Keys in Lists?
        Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered).
         To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.

        To better understand this, let  s refactor the code snippet we saw earlier, 
        to now include keys.

        9.What Is the Difference Between State and Props in React? 
        Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component,
         while state is used to manage data within a component. Props are immutable
          and cannot be changed within a component, while state is mutable and can
         be updated using the setState function.
